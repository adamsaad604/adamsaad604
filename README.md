# Hi, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research-driven analyst with a professional background in **fundamental equity research**, and a deep personal and academic interest in **quantitative finance**.

My GitHub is a curated collection of independent projects and study explorations ranging from factor investing models and event-driven strategies to valuation frameworks. Most projects are based on academic research or are extensions of my graduate-level coursework in quantitative finance.

ðŸ“Œ Areas of interest:
- Multi-factor models
- Algorithmic trading
- M&A event studies and merger arbitrage
- Option pricing using MATLAB
- Data automation via Python & Excel
